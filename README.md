# OpenSec

An open source InfoSec newsletter

This project is intended as a simple and technologically robust means of publication and consumption of information security news.

Submissions can be sent via a simple pull request, or (potentially, in the future) form submissions.

Sample briefings might include...

- A collection of "low-hanging fruit" settings to enable or disable that dramatically decrease attack surface when deploying a piece of software
- Notice of an urgent security patch for a commonly used library
- Explanation of a data breach from a commonly used vendor in movement spaces
- Notice of a zero day vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild
