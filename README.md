# OpenSec 📰

An open source InfoSec newsletter

## Concept

This project is intended as a simple and technologically robust means for collaborative publication and consumption of information security news.

Sample briefings might include...

- ⚙️ A collection of "low-hanging fruit" settings to enable or disable that dramatically decrease attack surface when deploying a piece of software.
- ⚠️ Notice of an urgent security patch for a commonly used library.
- ⁉️ Explanation of a data breach from a commonly used vendor in movement spaces.
- 🚨 Notice of a zero day vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild.

## Implementation

Initially, the project will be implemented as a simple static site for easy modification and archival. Support for an email newsletter, along with a Slackbot for push notifications, is intended.
